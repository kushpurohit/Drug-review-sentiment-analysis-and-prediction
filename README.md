# Drug Review Sentiment Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict sentiment in drug reviews. Using a dataset of drug reviews, the notebook explores various data preprocessing steps, sentiment analysis techniques, and machine learning models to predict the sentiment of new drug reviews.

## Contents
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Importing the dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the text data, handling missing values, and preparing the data for modeling.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of drug reviews.
- **Model Building**: Training and evaluating different machine learning models to predict the sentiment of drug reviews.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using various evaluation metrics.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- nltk

You can install the required libraries using pip:
